# SeqAl
> Sequence Alignment made easy

An iOS app that makes it easy to learn different sequence alignment algorithms. App currently includes support for Global, Local, Dovetail and Pattern search algorithms.

Appstore: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seqal/id1446372672?mt=8

## Installing and Building

Just open SeqAl.xcodeproj in Xcode and build.

## Features

* Animated walk through of the main steps of sequence alignment.
* Drill down to understand how a particular value of the grid was derived.
* QuizMode: Check your understanding by solving the aligment for a value on grid.
* Play, pause and ddjust the speed of animation.

## Next steps

Apart from code clean up:

* Onboarding flow along with a brief explanation of each of the supported algorithms.
* Scrolling support in both directions.
* iPad support
* Animations: better grid walkthrough and transition animation to detail view.
